# VREscapeRoom

Small Escape Room for VR (Unreal Engine 4)

Solution of the Escape Room:
Behind the large wall photo with the cat is a safe in the wall. You can open it with the code 9162, which you can find out from the pictures on the fireplace. Inside the safe, you will find the key to open the door.
Attention: The code on the safe can only be entered with the right hand (controller) and must be entered correctly once in a row, as the numbers reset if it is incorrect.

What is also possible in the room:
- The drawers of the cabinet can be opened and closed.
- There is a lighter in the cupboard that can be used to make fire in the fireplace.
- The pictures can be picked up.
- The small vase is breakable.
- The light can be turned on and off.
